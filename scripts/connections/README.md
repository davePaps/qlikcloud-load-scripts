# Connections

Add a resuable connection and library script(s) here

Purpose:

Stores reusable connection definitions (e.g. databases, APIs, file locations)

Supports environment-specific logic (DEV / TEST / PROD)

Prevents duplication of connection strings across load scripts

Makes credential and endpoint changes easier to manage

Enables consistent connection handling across apps
